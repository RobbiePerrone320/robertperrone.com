                    I am currently working as a ServiceNow Administrator and Developer at the Lower Hudson Regional Information Center 
                    (LHRIC), which operates within SWBOCES. This technology branch of the company provides technological support to 30+ 
                    districts in the Westchester, Putnam, and Rockland County areas.

                <h3>Carver Center - Lifeguard & Swim Instructor</h3>
                <h5><i>July 2017 - July 2022</i></h5>
                <p>
                    I started off at Carver Center just being a lifeguard, but my role soon evolved to include teaching 
                    swimming lessons to people of all ages. At first, I was just teaching younger kids around the ages of 7-10. 
                    This soon grew to include kids 6 and younger who needed more expoure to being in a pool, to teenagers on swim 
                    teams looking to improve their technique, to adults that were looking to learn to swim for the first time. 
                    My responsibilties included maintaining a safe and clean environment for patrons throughout my shift. 
                    Although the job was enjoyable, I learned to thrive in a serious and somewhat high stakes job that I had to be 
                    alert and present all the time to ensure the safety of the people swimming.

                <h3>The Brand Executives - Web Developer Intern</h3>
                <h5><i>June 2021 - July 2021</i></h5>
                <p>
                    Through this 8 week internship with The Brand Executives, I learned about web design using multiple page 
                    builders in WordPress. I learned a lot about the fundamentals of web design, page layouts, and cohesion with 
                    colors, pictures, and fonts. I was then able to take these fundamentals and apply them by designing websites 
                    for other real companies that The Brand Executives had as clients. Some of these websites are featured on my 
                    LinkedIn under the projects section.

                <h3>CodeAdvantage - Coding Instructor</h3>

                <p>
                    At CodeAdvantage, I had the opportunity to teach students of varying ages how to code. This included languages 
                    such as Python and HTML/CSS. I also taught some classes in Minecraft and Roblox Studio, which showed my students 
                    coding through a different lens. It provided them a more relatable and fun way to learn about the fundamentals rather 
                    than lines of code that they may not have been able to understand at their ages. This set my students up to learn more 
                    complex coding concepts and languages in the future. Even if they did not persue this later in life, it will still 
                    prove to be a valuable skillset for them as they get older.
