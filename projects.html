            <div id="thesis"><p>
                For my honors thesis project, I worked on the 
                <a href="https://github.com/onnx/onnx-mlir" target="_blank">ONNX-MLIR</a> Project with the 
                IBM team that works on this "<a href="http://onnx.ai/onnx-mlir/" target="_blank">open-source 
                project for compiling ONNX models into native code on x86, P and Z machines (and more)</a>". 
                Although I am no longer working on this project, it gave me a lot of insight into C++ code and 
                how this team operates. What makes them efficient and how they work so well together despite not 
                being in the same office, timezone, or even the same country. My mentor for this project was in a 
                completely different timezone, but we made it work really well.

                This portfolio website that you are on right now has been a project that I've been wanting to 
                work on for some time now. I was originally complacent with a WordPress website that I designed, 
                but I always wanted to buy my own domain name and build my website from scratch. Once I had 
                the resources and skills to do this, I jumped on the opportunity and started to work on this in my 
                free-time. I am very proud of how it is coming along so far and I will be continuing to mantain and 
                make this site even better as time goes on. The state of the website currently is a starting off point 
                and it is still a work in progress.
