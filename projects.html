            <h3>Rhinebeck Asher Dam Alert System (ADAS)</h3>

            <h3>Honors Thesis</h3>
            <div id="thesis"><p>
                For my honors thesis project, I worked on the 
                <a href="https://github.com/onnx/onnx-mlir" target="_blank">ONNX-MLIR</a> Project with the 
                IBM team that works on this "<a href="http://onnx.ai/onnx-mlir/" target="_blank">open-source 
                project for compiling ONNX models into native code on x86, P and Z machines (and more)</a>". 
                Although I am no longer working on this project, it gave me a lot of insight into C++ code and 
                how this team operates. What makes them efficient and how they work so well together despite not 
                being in the same office, timezone, or even the same country. My mentor for this project was in a 
                completely different timezone, but we made it work really well.

            <h3>Ray-Tracing</h3>
            <div id="ray-tracing"><p>
                In my Computer Graphics class, the professor provided us with the basis for a ray-tracing project, 
                which we built upon throughout the entire semester. You can find my code for this project here: 
                <a href="https://github.com/RobbiePerrone320/graphics-lab-activities" target="_blank">graphics-lab-activities</a>. 
                This project mostly contains JavaScript, but also utilizes some amount of HTML/CSS and GLSL programming 
                languages. I really enjoyed the problem-solving aspect of this project and although there was some guidance 
                with each step of the project, it did not hold your hand throughout the projects, which was something I 
                appreciated. We learned to add different things to our ray-tracer such as mirror reflections, shadows, 
                specular/diffused highlights and ambient lighting. The ray-tracer only started out with a plane and we 
                has to build different object to see in this space along with all of the different features of shadows/reflections 
                on our own.

            <h3>Operating System</h3>
            <div id="os"><p>
                My operating systems class was known to be one of the most difficult classes in my software development 
                concentration. This class was taught by Alan Labouseur at Marist College and the projects in this class 
                were incrememntal towards building a web-based Operating System. He encouraged creativity and going above 
                and beyond in each project. The toughest part about this was that each project built off of the last one 
                so if you were missing something or part of your code was not completely working, the next part of the 
                project was impacted by this. This did however encourage you to keep trying at the code and see if you 
                could fix your previous mistakes. The can find the code for this on my GitHub here: 
                <a href="https://github.com/RobbiePerrone320/OperatingSystems-2020" target="_blank">OperatingSystems-2020</a>.
                This was mainly written in TypeScript with some HTML/CSS and JS.

            <h3>Caesar Cipher in 10 Languages</h3>
            <div id="caesar-cipher"><p>
                The "Caesar Cipher in 10 different languages" was a project for my Theory of Programming Languages course. 
                This class taught us about how different programming languages are structured and why there are so many different 
                languages. There were 2 main projects in the class, with one being to program a caesar cipher in 5 different 
                procedural languages and the other to program a caesar cipher in 5 different functional languages. Scala was 
                used in both projects to demonstrate its versatility. Our final project was to create our own language that 
                best suited our own needs and we could design it how we saw fit. My language named Kona (after my dog) is a 
                combination of Visual BASIC and Java. You can find the link to the code on my GitHub here: 
                <a href="https://github.com/RobbiePerrone320/TheoryOfProgrammingLanguages-2021" target="_blank">TheoryOfProgrammingLanguages-2021</a>. 
                The languages used in these projects were Fortran, COBOL, Pascal, Scala, Visual BASIC, LISP, Erlang, F Sharp, 
                and Haskell.

            <h3>Arduino</h3>
            <div id="arduino"><p>
                The last noteworthy project from my coursework at Marist was our Arduino projects that I worked on in the Spring 
                of 2020. This was for the class Computer Organization and Architecture, which taught things relating to how computers 
                read and store information. Along with how to count, read, and solve math problems in binary. However, I definitely am 
                out of practice with binary, I still very much enjoyed learning about it. We also learned about Hexidecimal since it is 
                used so much in coding such as with ASCII characters and HEX values for colors in web design. The arduino projects were 
                challenging but so much fun once it was working the way you wanted it to. Having the hands-on experience of wiring an 
                coding on an arduino and then seeing the changes happen right in front of you was so much fun. I really enjoyed the problem-solving 
                and puzzle-like nature of these projects. I have some of the code from these projects up on my GitHub, although I wish I had more 
                videos of the final results from these projects to share. Here is the link to the page here:
                <a href="https://github.com/RobbiePerrone320/ComputerOrganizationandArchitecture-2020" target="_blank">ComputerOrganizationandArchitecture-2020</a>. 
                The language used in these projects was C and I mainly coded within the Arduino web editor to test and run my code.

            <h3>Portfolio Website</h3>
            <div id="portfolio"><p>
                This portfolio website that you are on right now has been a project that I've been wanting to 
                work on for some time now. I was originally complacent with a WordPress website that I designed, 
                but I always wanted to buy my own domain name and build my website from scratch. Once I had 
                the resources and skills to do this, I jumped on the opportunity and started to work on this in my 
                free-time. I am very proud of how it is coming along so far and I will be continuing to mantain and 
                make this site even better as time goes on. The state of the website currently is a starting off point 
                and it is still a work in progress.
