            <h2 class="center">Marist College</h2>
            <div id="marist"><p>
                In May 2022, I received my Bachelor of Science from Marist College in Poughkeepsie, NY with 
                an overall GPA of 3.641. I majored in Computer Science with a concentration in Software 
                Development and minors in Cybersecurity, Information Technology, & Information Systems. 
                Throughout my 4 years at Marist, I met a lot of amazing people, which includes my friends 
                and my professors. I learned a lot about being independent and self-sufficient. I also 
                mastered time-management and how to be a fast learner. I pick up new skills quickly and will 
                teach myself beyond what is required of me.

            <h3>Honors</h3>
            <div id="honors"><p>
                I was also involved in the Marist honors program where I took extra courses beyond my major, 
                which challenged me beyond my normal classes. This helped me to become a more well-rounded 
                individual and allowed me to be an even better critical thinker. I took all kinds of honors 
                classes such as an Environmental Science & Policies class, a class in Data Visualization 
                where I worked one-on-one with an IBM employee, an Italian Opera class, and a class in the 
                Ethical Implications of Technology. I also had my honors thesis class, which I worked on 
                ONNX-MLIR with the IBM team that maintains and updates the open-source code. Go to my 
                <a href="projects">projects</a> page to learn more about this.
                <br><br>
                Alongside these courses, during my senior year I was asked to be the senior honors 
                representative of the Computer Science department by the Director of the Honors Program, Dr. 
                Carolyn Matheus. Through this leadership role, myself and the other senior honors 
                representatives from the other disciplines helped to guide Dr. Matheus with decisions 
                regarding the honors program. We were the voice of the students and we helped to plan events 
                as well.
                <br><br>
                Other than the Marist Honors Program, I also joined the Marist chapters of the Emerging 
                Leaders Program (ELP), and the National Society of Leadership and Success (NSLS). I attended 
                Leadership seminars and webinars, which gave me a lot of different perspectives and ideas on 
                how I can be a better leader in my everyday life.

            <h3>Extracurricular Activities</h3>
            <div id="extracurricular"><p>
                I kept myself very busy during my time at Marist. Along with completing my degree and being 
                in the honors program, I was involved in a bunch of music-related groups. This included 
                the Marist Band, Brass Ensemble, Jazz Band, Marist Singers, Chamber Choir, and 
                <a href="https://linktr.ee/TimeCheckACappella" target="_blank">Time Check</a>, Marist College's 
                All-Male Identifying A Cappella group. These groups took up a lot of time, but I was able to 
                manage my time well and get all of my work done while also maintaining a good GPA and social 
                life.
                <br><br>
                In my last year in Time Check, I was one of the co-directors of this student-led group. My 
                responsibilities as a director included managing the social media accounts, speaking on behalf 
                of our group at events to promote the group, handing out business cards, responding to our emails, 
                and making sure the group stayed on track during our music rehearsals. I also made sure that everyone 
                was informed of upcoming events and choosing arrival times to make sure that we had enough time to 
                warm-up before performing. One thing that I am both proud and excited for is our upcoming album that 
                I had a big role in getting it funded as well as setting up communications with someone to record, 
                and mix the album, which also involved setting up times to record that worked with everyone's 
                schedules. Although it was a lot of work, I had the best time of my life in this group and made 
                friendships that will last a lifetime.
